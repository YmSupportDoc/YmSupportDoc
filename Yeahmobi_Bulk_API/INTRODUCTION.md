## INTRODUCTION
Yeahmobi’s Bulk API provides a feed for publishers to retrieve all available information via programmatically calling.

The bulk API is designed especially for developers who have in-app promoting. It allows developers to automate:

- Getting accurate offer information to match specific app source: publishers do not need to do further filtering on offers. Once the publisher’s app is specified, Yeahmobi will return the offers fit for the app only;

- Retrieving structured data based on products to get varieties of information from app stores: publishers do not need to manually get app store data, Yeahmobi will return all offer-related product information from the app store;

- Easier testing on different offers of same product: Yeahmobi groups offers, icons and all other creatives based on product and provides CDN service on creatives which can be directly use for promoting.
